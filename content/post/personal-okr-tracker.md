### Why another goal tracker?

There are already plenty of habit and goal tracking apps out there. Personal OKR Tracker is building upon the [OKR methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) developed by Google which is well known in the business area and can also be utilized for personal goal tracking.  This framework is very lightweight and gives guidance on how to manage your goals.

It organizes your goals on a quarterly basis and enforces specific measures (key results) to track the progress of the goal (objective).

### What it’s not?

Due to the foundation of OKRs the tracker might not be suited as a **habit**  **tracker** as goals are comprised of different sub-steps (like milestones) that contribute to the overarching goal (the objective) as opposed to a continuous effort of a single measure. (e.g. Do X for Y times a week) — there are better tools out there for building up a habit.

## What it does

With a setup of two simple steps, you can define your goals for the current or upcoming quarter.

Once you are set, the home-screen of the tracker will show you the current quarter with its objectives.

### Grading key results

Viewing a key result lets you adapt the grading and add **notes** to it. **Grading details** which are defined in the setup process help you to pick reasonable progress.

Revisiting your goals and grading them is crucial. Therefore the OKR tracker has a **reminder** feature to ensure you’re goals are up-to-date.
