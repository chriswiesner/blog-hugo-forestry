###### My side project Visual Timer is already celebrating its 4th birthday in February. Time to take a look at what it has grown to and see what 2020 looked like in numbers.

> ### 4.302.166

This is the number of finished timers ⏲  last year.  
It's great to see that a small utility developed by a single person can help a lot of people!

### Growth

Compared to 2019 the number of finished timers grew by **60% 🚀**

As you can see in the above chart, the pandemic is also visible here. I guess that applies to a lot of software products in the last year.

Also in terms of **monthly and weekly** users there was a growth of around **20%**. ⬆️

The userbase in terms of **installs** on active devices grew from around 93k (2019) to 129k (2020) . This is an increase of **+38% YoY**

The majority of the increase is again happening in the 1st lockdown of the pandemic.

### Updates

Allthough there were no big feature updates in 2020, still some smaller increments where shipped.

#### Version 2.4

> 🔂 You can select that the alarm sound is played only once

### Insights

📝 Last year there were nearly **200.000 timer presets created** (+48% YoY) in the app.  
Presets can be created for frequently used timer durations where its possible to specify a timer color and name your timer task. Also presets allow to add [app-shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts/) to the homescreen so that you can start the preset timer by a simple tap without ever entering the app itself. Those shortcuts where used over 50k times in 2020.

🗣 Number of **ratings** increased to **7.609** and currently **3.209** users wrote a **review**.  
This should even get better now with the implemented in-app rating shown above.  
App **ratings** remained stable around **4,7**.

### Review Highlights

> I love the Ambiant Mode. It really helps me focus.

> 
>
> Perfect to show the kids how much time still remains...

> Functional, easy, clean, to the point, exactly what I was looking for. THANK YOU for not over-engineering. Just needed a reliable kitchen timer and this does exactly what I want it to.

> Just like the "time timer" but better because the time limit can be customized, saved, and the colors changed. NO ADS & FREE. I'm so thankful everyone can have access to this important tool. ❤️❤️❤️

> So effective in making kids manage their tasks in time. Perfect

### Outlook

In 2020 there were also a lot of feedback ideas submitted.  
I try to keep a balance of addressing feedback and adding increments for specific use-cases but still protecting the app experience of getting bloated for the majority of users who do not need to much personalization.
